# 🏠 House Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.  
This project uses Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict house prices.  
We perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, clean and preprocess the dataset, train the model, evaluate it, and save it for future use.

---

## 📂 Dataset
We use the **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).  
The dataset contains **1,460 entries** and **80 features** (numerical & categorical).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data handling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning
- **Pickle** – Model saving

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Checked for missing values and handled them using median/mode imputation.
- Visualized target variable distribution and feature relationships using:
  - Histogram & KDE plots
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Scatter plots
  - Box plots
